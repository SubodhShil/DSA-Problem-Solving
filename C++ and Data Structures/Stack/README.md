> # **```Stack```**

A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last in First Out) or **FILO (First In Last Out)** manner, in which an item can be added or removed from only one end. Hence, we can say any item can be added or inserted and removed from a single door.

<ins>**Push**</ins>: Insert an element from last of the stack.  
<ins>**Pop**</ins>: Remove an element from last of the stack.  
<ins>**Peek**</ins>: To see the top element or last element.  

1. Stack can be implemented by array. In this case, an index poniter **top** will be initialized with value -1.
2. Size of the stack is top + 1.
3. If, top iterator value is -1 then the stack is empty.


## Monotonic stack 

When we're storing values in specific (increasing or decreasing) order to the stack is said to be a monotonic stack.
